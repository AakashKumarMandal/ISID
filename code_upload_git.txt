# Added Additive White Gaussian Noise to compare   the performance of the classifier in presence of    normal versus noisy environment.
	
	mean= a
	standard deviation= b [Changed these two 		variables a and b to generated different         	noise levels]

# Changed sample frequencies of the data [tested      with various sample frequencies]

# Designed a moving average filter to increase        accuracy [found the best filtered result by       adding two filter co-efficients a,b]

# Splitted the dataset into two parts [training       set and test set] 

# Tested with different training length for     experimental purpose and find the optimum           traininglengh for best result.

# Preprocessed of both training set and test set     data

# Applied LDA on both training and test set data

# Classified the training set data

# Pfredicted the test set results

# Created confusion matrix [3*3 matrix   generated   since there exist three classes of   data]

# Measured accuracy of the classifier
